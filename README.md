## by (Tony Ezepue)


## Dataset

>  The Ford Go data consists of information regarding 183,412 rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. The data features include duration (secs) and others such as DateTime, customer type, gender, and some additional variables.The source of my file is a csv file.The Data types include object,float,integer. Then datetime being an object in the data, i converted it to datetime format and also dropped the missing nan values from my table and created few tables from start time and end time column.After the cleaning process i was left with 174952 rows and 24 columns from the data set to perform explonatory visualisation.


## Summary of Findings

> Both male and female and others covered equal distance by seconds spent with the bike.old people travel less in terms of seconds compared to young persons.which can be attributed to strenght.it is also gathered that males use bike services 3x more than females.Customer user type trips take a longer duration compared to subscriber user type.These will not be added to my explanatory visualisation.


## Key Insights for Presentation
* The higher ride frequencies for the morning (8th and 9th hrs) and evening (17th and 18th hrs) can be linked to rush hours where people       leave for work and come back later in the evening.
* Weekend trips take a longer duration as compared to trips taken during the week.
* Customer user type trips take a longer duration compared to subscriber user type.
* Weekend trips take a longer duration as compared to trips taken during the week.
